# Honda HRX217 Plastic Deck Repair
![Graph](img/trimetric.png)

A description of my repair of a Honda HRX217VLA lawnmower with extensive cracking of the plastic deck.

Includes a downloadable 3D model of the plastic ring I designed to reinforce the damaged area of the deck.

Assemble PVC components with the appropriate primer and cement. I used `Weld-On 15900 Twin Pack 780 PVC Regular-Bodied Plumbing Solvent Cement and Purple Plumbing Primer` (Amazon $8.34).

Use yellow Teflon tape on threaded connections. e.g. `Eastman 1/2 Inch x 260 Inch Teflon Pipe Thread for Gas Lines, 4 mil` (Amazon $2.20).

I used TE CPC connectors only because I had some on hand -- use something cheaper...

I have a 19.2V cordless drill battery pack that I pressed into service. Standard 0.25" quick-connect terminals will fit the battery's terminals. 
I added a pair of inline fuses (under the heat shrink) to prevent accidental damage... The control box contains only a momentary toggle switch for firing.

## Projectile ("Spud")

| | Qty | Desc | Source |
| :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | End cap | End_Cap_v3a.STL or End_Cap_v4.STL |
| 2 | 2.5in | 1/2" PVC pipe, Sch 40 | Home Depot, etc.  $1.56 / 24in |

I attached the end caps using self-tapping screws to allow experimenting with additional weight.\
I haven't found this to be necessary, though; the basic 0.7oz spud seems to work fine.

Material cost for each projectile is around $0.25, so you can afford to lose a few in the trees....

The end caps feature a loop to tie the fishing line to without any additional hardware.


## Usage

The unit as described here worked perfectly to launch a line over an approximately 55ft tall tree, using a 50 PSI charge. I haven't done any performance testing beyond that.

I loaded the reel with 15lb monofilament line (`Walmart, $2.42 for 500 yards`) and launched the line over the tree. I then pulled over some sisal (?) twine, 
and finally used the twine to pull the 3/16" Dacron antenna rope.

Additional weight could easily be added to the spuds. They're very light (0.7oz) and might benefit from some added mass, although I haven't tried this.

Many of the designers of similar projects state that modifying the valve for pneumatic triggering gives a noticeable performance improvement (see links below). 
I haven't tried this; electrical activation was easier and worked well enough for my purposes. 

One drawback of this design is that the 3d-printed end caps on the spuds can shatter if they collide hard with an obstacle. Print a couple extra!
